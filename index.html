			<h2>Information about the website</h2>
			<p>Hi and welcome to my website. This was the submission that won the 2016 Hour of Code as BPS web design competition. After I had won the contest, I made some adjustments including a banner background and some minor alignment changes. Additionally the content has been updated as of 2/10/2017. However, I will likely not be updating this website any further and instead remaking it on another domain, maybe even just replace this one. Anyways. this website goes over the hardware and software aspects of computers as well as a short guide on how to build one. More will be added to the new domain over Summer 2017 including a personal page and a more detailed guides (hopefully with newer hardware since I'll bo doing some upgrades and want to kill a bird with two stones. As of now, this website is simply used as a personal time sink. Thank you for visiting.
